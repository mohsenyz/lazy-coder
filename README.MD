# Java utils for lazy coders

Basic useful feature list:

 * create pure pojo form mysqlvardump result of your database
 * create spring object mapper for your pojo

------------------------

### Why did i make it?? :-|

One i decided to make pure pojo from my database,
It was about 35 table with average of 15 coulmn per table

of course that there was a lot of pojo maker, but there wasn't a row mapper maker.

I tried to write rowMappers myself and it took me about 2 hours.

So like [Hacker scripts](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts) i decided to automate every work which take me more than a hour.

This is why i developed this hell!
